# linlab

Custom Linear Algebra algorithms, including infinite-dimension gram-schmidt and span-to-distance computations.

Made with MATLAB.

Note: Computations are experimental and have not been second-hand reviewed, so use in academic work is not advised. With limited testing, functions appear to be accurate for arguments less than four dimensions. Problem and solution sets of four or more dimensions were not available at the time of testing.

# Getting started

1. Register and install MATLAB.
2. Move MATLAB code files (.m) into the MATLAB file directory path.
3. Invoke, within your MATLAB scripts, the function declared in each file.
